# Surescripts Internship
Hello Surescripts, the project I chose to submit was for my Databases class.  The goal of the project was to incorporate retrieving information from a database with a Object-Oriented Language.  This project touches base with SQL, Object-Oriented design, and GUI development.  This project uses a private University of Wisconsin Server, so it will not be able to run, without being on a UWEC server or with proper credentials. 

# Completed Project
 This project simulated what an online book database might look like in Java.  There where 3 tabs that the user could search from, Author name, Category of books, and Publisher.
